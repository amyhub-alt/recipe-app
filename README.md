# Recipe App

This is a Django-based web application that allows users to create and manage recipes. Users can add a recipe name, cooking time, list of ingredients, and a short description, as well as specify the difficulty level.

The app includes:
- A data model for storing recipes
- A Django admin interface to add/view/update/delete recipes
- A basic test suite to ensure the model functions correctly

Built as part of a Python/Django learning project.
